## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development and AI systems. Building upon concepts from the previous laboratory, it explores sophisticated techniques for integrating LLMs into various workflows.

Please refer to the [main README]() for setup instructions and environment configuration.

## Key Components

The project introduces three new packages, each focusing on a different aspect of LLM applications:

- **it.unibo.requirements**: Demonstrates how LLMs (specifically Gemini 2 models) can be leveraged for automated requirements engineering and specification generation.

- **it.unibo.copilot**: Contains a complete implementation showcasing code refactoring techniques with LLM assistance. This module provides practical examples of how LLMs can improve existing codebases.

- **it.unibo.rag**: Explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance LLM capabilities by incorporating external knowledge sources, improving reasoning and domain-specific expertise.

Each package contains examples, documentation, and exercises to help you understand these advanced LLM applications.
